                <p>
                I've had a passion for computing since I was a young boy, when I found out how to mess with the settings on my parents' computers (often to their chagrin). Since then, I've always been fascinated by the "how" and "why" of different facets of computing.
                <br></br>
                After moving from Calgary, Canada to Scottsdale, AZ, taking computing-related courses in high school eventually led me to pursue an undergrad in Computer Science at Arizona State University. In my studies, I've grown to enjoy and become proficient in several disciplines, including both front and back-end development, and cybersecurity.
                <br></br>
                My interests have led me to many exciting opportunities such as participating in and organizing hackathons, internships, and both collaborative & independent projects. I take pride in my drive to learn, my desire to collaborate, and my goal to write clean, functional code in my work.
                <br></br>
